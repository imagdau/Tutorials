    "In this tutorial, you will do a dive into the `MACE` code, which is a highly accurate and efficient MLIP. If you would like to understand this method in more detail, you can find the [original method paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/4a36c3c51af11ed9f34615b81edb5bbc-Paper-Conference.pdf). MACE is a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNNs) Interatomic Potential that forms equivariant many body messages.\n",
